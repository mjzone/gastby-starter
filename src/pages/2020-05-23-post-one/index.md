## Why
Typical business projects are executing the business plan and doing that in relatively known environments using KPIs that are developed to measure their performance. Innovation projects, however, are looking for sustainable business models in unfamiliar environments and are often pushed into using the same KPIs as other business projects. Because of different natures of the projects, we believe companies should separate those 2 activities as much as possible and develop a tailored set of KPIs suitable for innovation projects.

## How

Dan Toma & Tendayi Viki (authors of The Corporate Startup) are suggesting corporations use 3 levels of KPIs each tailored for different level innovation stakeholder.

- Reporting KPIs

  - Designed to measure the progress of incubated new ventures from ideation through to product-market fit.

- Governance KPIs

  - Helping paint a better picture for the board members as to whether or not to continue investing in particular ventures. Note: at this level, some companies will push innovation projects towards NPV calculations. Surprise, but there is an accounting way to valuate the innovation projects while taking into account the risky environments that they operate in. David Binetti explains how innovation accounting can be used for estimating NPVHEs in a 20-minute video.

- Global KPIs
  - These examine the overall performance of the innovation department within the context of the larger business.
